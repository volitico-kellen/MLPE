# MLPE
Metric Lattice for Performance Estimation


Without any specification, MPLE will catagorize data with a prediction as test data and training data otherise;
and any numeric fields will be considered feature data and demographic attributes otherwise.


Ensure there are no NaN values in feature data (replace with median, mean, etc.). NaN is fine in demographic categories.
